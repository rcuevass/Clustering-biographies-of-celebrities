meanwhile clinton had repeatedly asked rodham to marry him and she continued to demur after failing the district of columbia bar exam and passing the arkansas exam rodham came to a key decision as she

living room a story about the marriage in the arkansas gazette indicated that she was retaining the name hillary rodham the motivation was to keep the couples professional lives separate and avoid apparent conflicts of interest and because as she told a friend at the time it showed that i was still me the decision did upset both their mothers bill clinton had lost the congressional race in 1974

1979 the latter continued her argument that childrens legal competence depended upon their age and other circumstances and that in serious medical rights cases judicial intervention was sometimes warranted an american bar association chair later said her articles were important not because they were radically new but because they helped formulate something that had been inchoate historian

she was first lady of arkansas she earned less than the other partners as she billed fewer hours but still made more than 200000 in her final year there the firm considered her a rainmaker because she brought in clients partly thanks to the prestige she lent it and to her corporate board connections she was also very influential in the appointment of state judges bill clintons republican opponent in his 1986 gubernatorial reelection campaign accused the clintons of conflict of interest because rose law did state business the clintons countered the charge by saying that state fees were walled off by the firm before her profits were calculated from 1982 to 1988 clinton was on the board of directors sometimes as chair of the new world foundation which funded a variety of new left interest groups from 1987 to 1991 she was the first chair of the american bar associations commission on women in the profession created to address gender bias in the legal profession and induce the

received sustained national attention for the first time when her husband became a candidate for the democratic presidential nomination of 1992 before the new hampshire primary tabloid publications printed assertions that bill clinton had engaged in an extramarital affair with arkansas lounge singer gennifer flowers in response the clintons appeared together on 60 minutes where bill clinton denied the affair but acknowledged causing pain in my marriage this joint appearance was credited with rescuing his campaign during it hillary clinton made culturally disparaging remarks about tammy wynettes outlook on marriage as described in her classic song stand by your man and later in the campaign about how she could have chosen to be like women staying home and baking cookies and having teas but wanted to pursue her career instead the remarks were widely criticized particularly by those who were or defended stayathome mothers and in retrospect were illconsidered by her own admission bill clinton said that in electing him the nation would get two for the price of one referring to the prominent role his wife would assume beginning with daniel wattenbergs august 1992 the american spectator article the lady macbeth of little rock hillary clintons own past ideological and ethical record came under attack from conservatives at least twenty other articles in major publications also drew comparisons between her and lady macbeth    first lady of the united states     role as first lady  when bill clinton took office as president in january 1993 hillary rodham clinton became the first lady of the united states and her press secretary reiterated that she would be using that form of her name she was the initial first lady to hold a postgraduate degree and to have her own professional career up to the time of entering the white house she was also the first to have an office in the west wing of the white house in addition to the usual first lady offices in the east wing she was part of the innermost circle vetting appointments to the new administration and her choices filled at least eleven toplevel positions and dozens more lowerlevel ones after eleanor roosevelt clinton is regarded as the most openly empowered presidential wife in american history  some critics called it inappropriate for the first lady to play a central role in matters of public policy supporters pointed out that clintons role in policy was no different from that of other white house advisors and that voters had been well aware that she would play an active role in her husbands presidency bill clintons campaign promise of two for the price of one led opponents to refer derisively to the clintons as copresidents or sometimes the arkansas label billary the pressures of conflicting ideas about the role of a first lady were enough to send clinton into imaginary discussions with the alsopoliticallyactive eleanor roosevelt from the time she came to washington she also found refuge in a prayer group of the fellowship that featured many wives of conservative washington figures triggered in part by the death of her father in april 1993 she publicly sought to find a synthesis of methodist teachings liberal religious political philosophy and tikkun editor michael lerners politics of meaning to overcome what she saw as americas sleeping sickness of the soul that would lead to a willingness to remold society by redefining what it means to be a human being in the twentieth century moving into a new millennium other segments of the public focused on her appearance which had evolved over time from inattention to fashion during her days in arkansas to a popular site in the early days of the world wide web devoted to showing her many different and frequently analyzed hairstyles as first lady to an appearance on the cover of vogue magazine in 1998    health care and other policy initiatives   in january 1993 president clinton named first lady clinton to chair a task force on national health care reform hoping to replicate the success she had in leading the effort for arkansas education reform unconvinced regarding the merits of the north american free trade agreement nafta she privately urged that passage of health care reform be given higher priority the recommendation of the task force became known as the clinton health care plan a comprehensive proposal that would require employers to provide health coverage to their employees through individual health maintenance organizations its opponents quickly derided the plan as hillarycare and it faced opposition from even some democrats in congress some protesters against the proposed plan became vitriolic and during a july 1994 bus tour to rally support for the plan clinton wore a bulletproof vest at times  failing to gather enough support for a floor vote in either the house or the senate although democrats controlled both chambers the proposal was abandoned in september 1994 clinton later acknowledged in her memoir that her political inexperience partly contributed to the defeat but cited many other factors the first ladys approval ratings which had generally been in the high50s percent range during her first year fell to 44 percent in april 1994 and 35 percent by september 1994 republicans made the clinton health care plan a major campaign issue of the 1994 midterm elections which saw a net republican gain of fiftythree seats in the house election and seven in the senate election winning control of both many analysts and pollsters found the plan to be a major factor in the democrats defeat especially among independent voters the white house subsequently sought to downplay hillary clintons role in shaping policy opponents of universal health care would continue to use hillarycare as a pejorative label for similar plans by others  along with senators ted kennedy and orrin hatch she was a force behind the passage of the state childrens health insurance program in 1997 a federal effort that provided state support for children whose parents could not provide them with health coverage and conducted outreach efforts on behalf of enrolling children in the program once it became law she promoted nationwide immunization against childhood illnesses and encouraged older women to seek a mammogram to detect breast cancer with coverage provided by medicare she successfully sought to increase research funding for prostate cancer and childhood asthma at the national institutes of health the first lady worked to investigate reports of an illness that affected veterans of the gulf war which became known as the gulf war syndrome enactment of welfare reform was a major goal of her husbands but when the first two bills on it came from the republicancontrolled congress lacked protections for people going off welfare she urged him to veto them which he did a third version came up during his 1996 general election campaign that restored some of the protections but cut the scope of benefits in other areas critics including her past mentor edelman urged her to get the president to veto it again but she decided to support the bill which became the welfare reform act of 1996 as the best political compromise available this caused a rift with edelman that clinton later called sad and painful together with attorney general janet reno clinton helped create the office on violence against women at the department of justice in 1997 she initiated and shepherded the adoption and safe families act which she regarded as her greatest accomplishment as first lady in 1999 she was instrumental in the passage of the foster care independence act which doubled federal monies for teenagers aging out of foster care as first lady clinton hosted numerous white house conferences including ones on child care 1997 on early childhood development and learning 1997 and on children and adolescents 2000 she also hosted the firstever white house conference on teenagers 2000 and the firstever white house conference on philanthropy 1999 clinton traveled to 79 countries during this time breaking the mark for mosttraveled first lady held by pat nixon she did not hold a security clearance or attend national security council meetings but played a role in us diplomacy attaining its objectives a march 1995 fivenation trip to south asia on behest of the us state department and without her husband sought to improve relations with india and pakistan clinton was troubled by the plight of women she encountered but found a warm response from the people of the countries she visited and gained a better relationship with the american press corps the trip was a transformative experience for her and presaged her eventual career in diplomacy in a september 1995 speech before the fourth world conference on women in beijing clinton argued very forcefully against practices that abused women around the world and in the peoples republic of china itself declaring that it is no longer acceptable to discuss womens rights as separate from human rights delegates from over 180 countries heard her say if there is one message that echoes forth from this conference let it be that human rights are womens rights and womens rights are human rights once and for all in doing so she resisted both internal administration and chinese pressure to soften her remarks the speech became a key moment in the empowerment of women and years later females around the world would recite clintons key phrases she was one of the most prominent international figures during the late 1990s to speak out against the treatment of afghan women by the taliban she helped create vital voices an international initiative sponsored by the us to promote the participation of women in the political processes of their countries it and clintons own visits encouraged women to make themselves heard in the northern ireland peace process    whitewater and other investigations   first lady clinton was a subject of several investigations by the united states office of the independent counsel committees of the us congress and the press the whitewater controversy was the focus of media attention from the publication of a new york times report during the 1992 presidential campaign and throughout her time as first lady the clintons had lost their late1970s investment in the whitewater development corporation at the same time their partners in that investment jim and susan mcdougal operated madison guaranty a savings and loan institution that retained the legal services of rose law firm and may have been improperly subsidizing whitewater losses madison guaranty later failed and clintons work at rose was scrutinized for a possible conflict of interest in representing the bank before state regulators that her husband had appointed she said she had done minimal work for the bank independent counsels robert fiske and kenneth starr subpoenaed clintons legal billing records she said she did not know where they were the records were found in the first ladys white house book room after a twoyear search and delivered to investigators in early 1996 the delayed appearance of the records sparked intense interest and another investigation concerning how they surfaced and where they had been clintons staff attributed the problem to continual changes in white house storage areas since the move from the arkansas governors mansion on january 26 1996 clinton became the first first lady to be subpoenaed to testify before a federal grand jury after several independent counsels had investigated a final report was issued in 2000 that stated there was insufficient evidence that either clinton had engaged in criminal wrongdoing  scrutiny of the may 1993 firings of the white house travel office employees an affair that became known as travelgate began with charges that the white house had used audited financial irregularities in the travel office operation as an excuse to replace the staff with friends from arkansas the 1996 discovery of a twoyearold white house memo caused the investigation to focus on whether hillary clinton had orchestrated the firings and whether the statements she made to investigators about her role in the firings were true the 2000 final independent counsel report concluded she was involved in the firings and that she had made factually false statements but that there was insufficient evidence that she knew the statements were false or knew that her actions would lead to firings to prosecute her following deputy white house counsel vince fosters july 1993 suicide allegations were made that hillary clinton had ordered the removal of potentially damaging files related to whitewater or other matters from fosters office on the night of his death independent counsel kenneth starr investigated this and by 1999 starr was reported to be holding the investigation open despite his staff having told him there was no case to be made when starrs successor robert ray issued his final whitewater reports in 2000 no claims were made against hillary clinton regarding this an outgrowth of the travelgate investigation was the june 1996 discovery of improper white house access to hundreds of fbi background reports on former republican white house employees an affair that some called filegate accusations were made that hillary clinton had requested these files and that she had recommended hiring an unqualified individual to head the white house security office the 2000 final independent counsel report found no substantial or credible evidence that hillary clinton had any role or showed any misconduct in the matter in march 1994 newspaper reports revealed her spectacular profits from trading in 197879 thus leading to the cattle futures controversy allegations were made in the press of conflict of interest and disguised bribery and several individuals analyzed her trading records but no formal investigation was made and she was never charged with any wrongdoing there was a controversy that arose in early 2001 over gifts made to the white house rather than to the clintons personally that were removed and shipped to the clintons private residence during the last year of bill clintons time in office following public pressure the couple returned 134000 worth of such gifts hillary clinton faced additional criticism for having possibly solicited personal gifts shortly before being sworn in as a senator at which time she would have been barred from accepting them    response to lewinsky scandal   in 1998 the clintons relationship became the subject of much speculation when investigations revealed that the president had engaged in an extramarital affair with white house intern monica lewinsky events surrounding the lewinsky scandal eventually led to the impeachment of bill clinton by the house of representatives when the allegations against her husband were first made public hillary clinton stated that they were the result of a vast rightwing conspiracy characterizing the lewinsky charges as the latest in a long organized collaborative series of charges by bill clintons political enemies rather than any wrongdoing by her husband she later said that she had been misled by her husbands initial claims that no affair had taken place after the evidence of president clintons encounters with lewinsky became incontrovertible she issued a public statement reaffirming her commitment to their marriage but privately was reported to be furious at him and was unsure if she wanted to stay in the marriage the white house residence staff noticed a pronounced level of tension between the couple during this period public reaction varied some women admired her strength and poise in private matters made public some sympathized with her as a victim of her husbands insensitive behavior others criticized her as being an enabler to her husbands indiscretions while still others accused her of cynically staying in a failed marriage as a way of keeping or even fostering her own political influence her public approval ratings in the wake of the revelations shot upward to around 70 percent the highest they had ever been in her 2003 memoir she would attribute her decision to stay married to a love that has persisted for decades and add no one understands me better and no one can make me laugh the way bill does even after all these years he is still the most interesting energizing and fully alive person i have ever met matters surrounding the lewinsky scandal left bill clinton with substantial legal bills in 2014 hillary clinton would state that she and bill had left the white house not only dead broke but in debt the statement may have been literally accurate but ignored the potentially enormous earnings potential of presidents upon leaving office as well as the couples ability to secure loans from banks    traditional duties  clinton initiated and was founding chair of the save americas treasures program a national effort that matched federal funds to private donations to preserve and restore historic items and sites including the flag that inspired the starspangled banner and the first ladies historic site in canton ohio she was head of the white house millennium council and

monroe and the map room to how it looked during world war ii working with arkansas interior decorator kaki hockersmith over an eightyear period she oversaw extensive privately funded redecoration efforts around the building often trying to make it look brighter these included changing the look of the treaty room a presidential study to along 19th century lines overall the redecoration brought mixed notices with victorian furnishings for the lincoln sitting room being criticized the most clinton hosted many largescale events at the white house such as a saint patricks day reception a state dinner for visiting chinese dignitaries a contemporary music concert that raised funds for music education in public schools a new years eve celebration at the turn of the 21st century and a state dinner honoring the bicentennial of the white house in november 2000    2000 us senate election   when new yorks longserving us senator daniel patrick moynihan announced his retirement in november 1998 several prominent democratic figures including representative charles b rangel of new york urged clinton to run for moynihans open seat in the senate election of 2000 once she decided to run the clintons purchased a home in chappaqua new york north of new york city in september 1999 she became the first first lady of the united states to be a candidate for elected office initially clinton expected to face rudy giuliani the mayor of new york city as her republican opponent in the election giuliani withdrew from the race in may 2000 after he was diagnosed with prostate cancer and matters related to his failing marriage became public and clinton instead faced rick lazio a republican member of the us house of representatives representing new yorks 2nd congressional district throughout

ease the strain in late 2005 clinton said that while immediate withdrawal from iraq would be a mistake bushs pledge to stay until the job is done was also misguided as it gave iraqis an openended

voting in favor of the 700 billion law that created the troubled asset relief program saying that it represented the interests of the american people it passed the senate 7425    2008 presidential campaign   clinton had been preparing for a potential candidacy for us president since at least early 2003 on january 20 2007 she announced via her website the formation of a presidential exploratory committee for the united states presidential election of 2008 stating im in and im in to win no woman had ever been nominated by a major party for the presidency when bill clinton became president in 1993 a blind trust was established in april 2007 the clintons liquidated the blind trust to avoid the possibility of ethical conflicts or political embarrassments as hillary clinton undertook her presidential race later disclosure statements revealed that the couples worth was now upwards of 50 million and that they had earned over 100 million since 2000 with most of it coming from bill clintons books speaking engagements and other activities throughout the first half of 2007 clinton led candidates competing for the democratic presidential nomination in opinion polls for the election senator barack obama of illinois and former senator john edwards of north carolina were her strongest competitors the biggest threat to her campaign was her past support of the iraq war which obama had opposed from the beginning clinton and obama both set records for early fundraising swapping the money lead each quarter  by september 2007 polling in the first six states holding democratic contests showed that clinton was leading in all of them with the races being closest in iowa and south carolina by the following month national polls showed clinton far ahead of democratic competitors at the end of october clinton suffered a rare poor debate performance against obama edwards and her other opponents obamas message of change began to resonate with the democratic electorate better than clintons message of experience the race tightened considerably especially in the early states of iowa new hampshire and south carolina with clinton losing her lead in some polls by december in the first vote of 2008 she placed third in the january 3 iowa democratic caucus behind obama and edwards obama gained ground in national polling in the next few days with all polls predicting a victory for him in the new hampshire primary clinton gained a surprise win there on january 8 defeating obama narrowly it was the first time a woman had won a major american partys presidential primary for the purposes of delegate selection explanations for clintons new hampshire comeback varied but often centered on her being seen more sympathetically especially by women after her eyes welled with tears and her voice broke while responding to a voters question the day before the election the nature of the contest fractured in the next few days several remarks by bill clinton and other surrogates and a remark by hillary clinton concerning martin luther king jr and lyndon b johnson were perceived by many as accidentally or intentionally limiting obama as a racially oriented candidate or otherwise denying the postracial significance and accomplishments of his campaign despite attempts by both hillary clinton and obama to downplay the issue democratic voting became more polarized as a result with clinton losing much of her support among african americans she lost by a twotoone margin to obama in the january 26 south carolina primary setting up with edwards soon dropping out an intense twoperson contest for the twentytwo february 5 super tuesday states bill clinton had made more statements attracting criticism for their perceived racial implications late in the south carolina campaign and his role was seen as damaging enough to her that a wave of supporters within and outside of the campaign said the former president needs to stop the south carolina campaign had done lasting damage to clinton eroding her support among the democratic establishment and leading to the prized endorsement of obama by ted kennedy  on super tuesday clinton won the largest states such as california new york new jersey and massachusetts while obama won more states they almost evenly split the total popular vote but obama was gaining more pledged delegates for his share of the popular vote due to better exploitation of the democratic proportional allocation rules the clinton campaign had counted on winning the nomination by super tuesday and was unprepared financially and logistically for a prolonged effort lagging in internet fundraising clinton began loaning money to her campaign there was continuous turmoil within the campaign staff and she made several toplevel personnel changes obama won the next eleven february contests across the country often by large margins and took a significant pledged delegate lead over clinton on march 4 clinton broke the string of losses by winning in ohio among other places where her criticism of nafta a major legacy of her husbands presidency helped in a state where the trade agreement was unpopular throughout the campaign obama dominated caucuses for which the clinton campaign largely ignored preparation obama did well in primaries where african americans or younger collegeeducated or more affluent voters were heavily represented clinton did well in primaries where hispanics or older noncollegeeducated or workingclass white voters predominated behind in delegates clintons best hope of winning the nomination came in persuading uncommitted partyappointed superdelegates  clintons admission in late march that her repeated campaign statements about having been under hostile fire from snipers during a march 1996 visit to us troops at tuzla air base in bosnia and herzegovina were not true attracted considerable media attention on april 22 she won the pennsylvania primary and kept her campaign alive on may 6 a narrowerthanexpected win in the indiana primary coupled with a large loss in the north carolina primary ended any realistic chance she had of winning the nomination she vowed to stay on through the remaining primaries but stopped attacks against obama as one advisor stated she could accept losing she could not accept quitting she won some of the remaining contests and indeed over the last three months of the campaign won more delegates states and votes than obama but she failed to overcome obamas lead following the final primaries on june 3 2008 obama had gained enough delegates to become the presumptive nominee in a speech before her supporters on june 7 clinton ended her campaign and endorsed obama by campaigns end clinton had won 1640 pledged delegates to obamas 1763 at the time of the clinching clinton had 286 superdelegates to obamas 395 with those numbers widening to 256 versus 438 once obama was acknowledged the winner clinton and obama each received over 17 million votes during the nomination process with both breaking the previous record clinton was the first woman to run in the primary or caucus of every state and she eclipsed by a very wide margin congresswoman shirley chisholms 1972 marks for most votes garnered and delegates won by a woman clinton gave a passionate speech supporting obama at the 2008 democratic national convention and campaigned frequently for him in fall 2008 which concluded with his victory over mccain in the general election on november 4 clintons campaign ended up severely in debt she owed millions of dollars to outside vendors and wrote off the 13 million that she lent it herself the debt was eventually paid off by the beginning of 2013    us secretary of state     nomination and confirmation   in midnovember 2008 presidentelect obama and clinton discussed the possibility of her serving as us secretary of state in his administration she was initially quite reluctant but on november 20 she told obama she would accept the position on december 1 presidentelect obama formally announced that clinton would be his nominee for secretary of state clinton said she did not want to leave the senate but that the new position represented a difficult and exciting adventure as part of the nomination and in order to relieve concerns of conflict of interest bill clinton agreed to accept several conditions and restrictions regarding his ongoing activities and fundraising efforts for the william j clinton foundation and clinton global initiative the appointment required a saxbe fix passed and signed into law in december 2008 confirmation hearings before the senate foreign relations committee began on january 13 2009 a week before the obama inauguration two days later the committee voted 161 to approve clinton by this time her public approval rating had reached 65 percent the highest point since the lewinsky scandal on january 21 2009 clinton was confirmed in the full senate by a vote of 942 clinton took the oath of office of secretary of state and resigned from the senate that same day she became the first former first lady to serve in the united states cabinet    first half of tenure   clinton spent her initial days as secretary of state telephoning dozens of world leaders and indicating that us foreign policy would change direction we have a lot of damage to repair she advocated an expanded role in global economic issues for the state department and cited the need for an increased us diplomatic presence especially in iraq where the defense department had conducted diplomatic missions clinton announced the most ambitious of her departmental reforms the quadrennial diplomacy and development review which establishes specific objectives for the state departments diplomatic missions abroad it was modeled after a similar process in the defense department that she was familiar with from her time on the senate armed services committee the first such review was issued in late 2010 and called for the us leading through civilian power as a costeffective way of responding to international challenges and defusing crises it also sought to institutionalize goals of empowering women throughout the world a cause clinton advocated throughout her tenure was the adoption of cookstoves in the developing world to foster cleaner and more environmentally sound food preparation and reduce smoke dangers to women  in an internal debate regarding the war in afghanistan during 2009 clinton sided with the militarys recommendations for a maximal afghanistan surge recommending 40000 troops and no public deadline for withdrawal she prevailed over vice president joe bidens opposition but eventually supported obamas compromise plan to send an additional 30000 troops and tie the surge to a timetable for eventual withdrawal in march 2009 clinton presented russian foreign minister sergey lavrov with a reset button symbolizing us attempts to rebuild ties with that country under its new president dmitry medvedev the photo op was remembered for a mistranslation into russian the policy which became known as the russian reset led to improved cooperation in several areas during medvedevs time in office but relations would worsen considerably following vladimir putins return to the position in 2012 in october 2009 on a trip to switzerland clintons intervention overcame lastminute snags and saved the signing of an historic turkisharmenian accord that established diplomatic relations and opened the border between the two longhostile nations in pakistan she engaged in several unusually blunt discussions with students talk show hosts and tribal elders in an attempt to repair the pakistani image of the us beginning in 2010 she helped organize a diplomatic isolation and international sanctions regime against iran in an effort to force curtailment of that countrys nuclear program this would eventually lead to the multinational joint comprehensive plan of action being agreed to in 2015 clinton and obama forged a good working relationship without power struggles she was a team player within the administration and a defender of it to the outside and was careful that neither she nor her husband would upstage the president clinton formed an alliance with secretary of defense gates as they shared similar strategic outlooks obama and clinton both approached foreign policy as a largely nonideological pragmatic exercise she met with him weekly but did not have the close daily relationship that some of her predecessors had had with their presidents moreover certain key areas of policymaking were kept inside the white house or pentagon nevertheless the president had trust in her actions  in a prepared speech in january 2010 clinton drew analogies between the iron curtain and the free and unfree internet chinese officials reacted negatively towards it and the speech garnered attention as the first time a senior american official had clearly defined the internet as a key element of american foreign policy in july 2010 secretary clinton visited korea vietnam pakistan and afghanistan all the while preparing for the july 31 wedding of daughter chelsea amid much media attention in late november 2010 clinton led the us damage control effort after wikileaks released confidential state department cables containing blunt statements and assessments by us and foreign diplomats    second half of tenure  the 2011 egyptian protests posed the most challenging foreign policy crisis for the administration yet clintons public response quickly evolved from an early assessment that the government of hosni mubarak was stable to a stance that there needed to be an orderly transition to a democratic participatory government to a condemnation of violence against the protesters obama came to rely upon clintons advice organization and personal connections in the behindthescenes response to developments as arab spring protests spread throughout the region clinton was at the forefront of a us response that she recognized was sometimes contradictory backing some regimes while supporting protesters against others  as the libyan civil war took place clintons shift in favor of military intervention aligned her with ambassador to the un susan rice and national security council figure samantha power and was a key turning point in overcoming internal administration opposition from defense secretary gates security advisor thomas donilon and counterterrorism advisor john brennan in gaining the backing for and arab and un approval of the 2011 military intervention in libya secretary clinton testified to congress that the administration did not need congressional authorization for its military intervention in libya despite objections from some members of both parties that the administration was violating the war powers resolution and the state departments legal advisor argued the same when the resolutions 60day limit for unauthorized wars was passed a view that prevailed in a legal debate within the obama administration clinton later used us allies and what she called convening power to promote unity among the libyan rebels as they eventually overthrew the gaddafi regime the aftermath of the libyan civil war saw the country becoming a failed state and the wisdom of the intervention and interpretation of what happened afterward would become the subject of considerable debate during april 2011 internal deliberations of the presidents innermost circle of advisors over whether to order us special forces to conduct a raid into pakistan against osama bin laden clinton was among those who argued in favor saying the importance of getting bin laden outweighed the risks to the us relationship with pakistan following completion of the mission on may 2 which resulted in bin ladens death clinton played a key role in the administrations decision not to release photographs of the dead alqaeda leader during internal discussions regarding iraq in 2011 clinton argued for keeping a residual force of up to 1000020000 us troops there all ended up being withdrawn after negotiations for a revised usiraq status of forces agreement failed  in a speech before the united nations human rights council in december 2011 clinton said that gay rights are human rights and that the us would advocate for gay rights and legal protections of gays abroad the same period saw her overcome internal administration opposition with a direct appeal to obama and stage the first visit to burma by a us secretary of state since 1955 as she met with burmese leaders as well as opposition leader aung san suu kyi and sought to support the 2011 burmese democratic reforms she also said that the 21st century would be americas pacific century a declaration that was part of the obama administrations pivot to asia during the syrian civil war clinton and the obama administration initially sought to persuade syrian president bashir alassad to engage popular demonstrations with reform then as government violence rose in august 2011 called for him to relinquish power the administration joined a number of allied countries in delivering nonlethal assistance to rebels opposed to the assad government as well as to humanitarian groups working in syria during mid2012 clinton formed a plan with cia director david petraeus to further strengthen the opposition by arming and training vetted groups of syrian rebels but the proposal was rejected by the white house who were reluctant to become entangled in the conflict and who feared that extremists hidden among the rebels might turn the weapons against other targets in december 2012 clinton was hospitalized for a few days for treatment of a blood clot in her right transverse venous sinus her doctors had discovered the clot during a followup examination for a concussion she had sustained when she had fainted and fallen nearly three weeks earlier after developing severe dehydration from a viral intestinal ailment acquired during a trip to europe the clot which caused no immediate neurological injury was treated with anticoagulant medication and her doctors subsequently said she made a full recovery    overall themes  throughout her time in office and in her final speech concluding it clinton viewed smart power as the strategy for asserting us leadership and values  in a world of varied threats weakened central governments and increasingly important nongovernmental entities  by combining military hard power with diplomacy and us soft power capacities in global economics development aid technology creativity and human rights advocacy as such she became the first secretary of state to methodically implement the smart power approach in debates over use of military force she was generally one of the more hawkish voices in the administration in august 2011 she hailed the ongoing multinational military intervention in libya and the initial us response towards the syrian civil war as examples of smart power in action clinton greatly expanded the state departments use of social media including facebook and twitter both to get its message out and to help empower citizens of foreign countries visvis their governments and in the mideast turmoil clinton particularly saw an opportunity to advance one of the central themes of her tenure the empowerment and welfare of women and girls worldwide moreover in a formulation that became known as the hillary doctrine she viewed womens rights as critical for us security interests due to a link between the level of violence against women and gender inequality within a state and the instability and challenge to international security of that state in turn there was a trend of women around the world finding more opportunities and in some cases feeling safer as the result of her actions and visibility clinton visited 112 countries during her tenure making her the most widely traveled secretary of state time magazine wrote that clintons endurance is legendary the first secretary of state to visit countries such as togo and timorleste she believed that inperson visits were more important than ever in the virtual age as early as march 2011 she indicated she was not interested in serving a second term as secretary of state should obama be reelected in 2012 in december 2012 following that reelection obama nominated senator john kerry to be clintons successor her last day as secretary of state was february 1 2013 upon her departure analysts commented that clintons tenure did not bring any signature diplomatic breakthroughs as some other secretaries of state had and highlighted her focus on goals that she thought were less tangible but would have more lasting effect    benghazi attack and subsequent hearings   on september 11 2012 the us diplomatic mission in benghazi libya was attacked resulting in the deaths of the us ambassador j christopher stevens and three other americans the attack questions surrounding the security of the us consulate and the varying explanations given afterward by administration officials for what had happened became politically controversial in the us on october 15 clinton took responsibility for the question of security lapses and said the differing explanations were due to the inevitable fog of war confusion after such events on december 19 a panel led by thomas r pickering and michael mullen issued its report on the matter it was sharply critical of state department officials in washington for ignoring requests for more guards and safety upgrades and for failing to adapt security procedures to a deteriorating security environment it focused its criticism on the departments bureau of diplomatic security and bureau of near eastern affairs four state department officials at the assistant secretary level and below were removed from their posts as a consequence clinton said she accepted the conclusions of the report and that changes were underway to implement its suggested recommendations clinton gave testimony to two congressional foreign affairs committees on january 23 2013 regarding the benghazi attack she defended her actions in response to the incident and while still accepting formal responsibility said she had had no direct role in specific discussions beforehand regarding consulate security congressional republicans challenged her on several points to which she responded in particular after persistent questioning about whether the administration had issued inaccurate talking points after the attack clinton responded with the muchquoted rejoinder with all due respect the fact is we had four dead americans was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night who decided that theyd they go kill some americans what difference at this point does it make it is our job to figure out what happened and do everything we can to prevent it from ever happening again senator in november 2014 the house intelligence committee issued a report that concluded there had been no wrongdoing in the administrations response to the attack  the house select committee on benghazi was created in may 2014 and has conducted lengthy investigations related to the 2012 attack in response to an interviewers question in september 2015 about what the republicans had accomplished in congress house majority leader kevin mccarthy credited the benghazi hearings with lowering clintons poll numbers mccarthys answer contradicted the republicans previous talking points on the investigation for example outgoing speaker of the house john boehner had consistently expressed disgust at any suggestion that the hearings were politically motivated on october 22 2015 clinton testified at an allday and nighttime session before the committee the hearing included many heated exchanges between committee members and clinton and between the committee members themselves clinton was widely seen as emerging largely unscathed from the hearing because of what the media perceived as a calm and unfazed demeanor and a lengthy meandering repetitive line of questioning from the committee    email controversy   a controversy arose in march 2015 when it was revealed by the state departments inspector general that clinton had exclusively used personal email accounts on a nongovernment privately maintained serverin lieu of email accounts maintained on federal government serverswhen conducting official business during her tenure as secretary of state some experts officials members of congress and political opponents contended that her use of private messaging system software and a private server violated state department protocols and procedures and federal laws and regulations governing recordkeeping requirements nearly 2100 emails contained in clintons server were retroactively marked classified by the state department though none of the emails were marked classified at the time they were sent 65 were later classified as secret more than 20 were designated top secret and the rest were later designated as confidential however the intelligence communitys inspector general wrote congress to say that some of the emails contained classified state department information when originated in a joint statement released on july 15 2015 the inspector general of the state department and the inspector general of the intelligence community said that through their review of the emails they found information that was classified when sent remained so as of their inspection and never should have been transmitted via an unclassified personal system they also stated unequivocally that those secrets never should have been stored outside of secure government computer systems mrs clinton had stated over a period of months that she kept no classified information on the private server that she set up in her house government policy reiterated in the nondisclosure agreement signed by clinton as part of gaining her security clearance is that sensitive information can be considered as classified even if not marked as such after allegations were raised that some of the emails in question fell into the socalled born classified category an fbi probe was initiated regarding how classified information was handled on the clinton server in may 2016 the inspector general of the state department criticized her use of a private email server while she was secretary of state stating that she had not requested permission to use it and even if she had she would not have been given permission the controversy occurred against the backdrop of clintons 2016 presidential election campaign and hearings held by the house select committee on benghazi    clinton foundation and speeches   when clinton left the state department she became a private citizen for the first time in thirty years she and her daughter joined her husband as named members of the bill hillary  chelsea clinton foundation in 2013 there she focused on early childhood development efforts including an initiative called too small to fail and a 600 million initiative to encourage the enrollment of girls in secondary schools worldwide led by former australian prime minister julia gillard clinton also led the no ceilings the full participation project a partnership with the bill and melinda gates foundation to gather and study data on the progress of women and girls around the world since the beijing conference in 1995 its march 2015 report said that while there has never been a better time in history to be born a woman  this data shows just how far we still have to go the foundation began accepting new donations from foreign governments which it had stopped doing while she was secretary she began work on another volume of memoirs and made appearances on the paid speaking circuit there she received 200000225000 per engagement often appearing before wall street firms or at business conventions she also made some unpaid speeches on behalf of the foundation for the fifteen months ending in march 2015 clinton earned over 11 million from her speeches for the overall period 200714 the clintons earned almost 141 million paid some 56 million in federal and state taxes and donated about 15 million to charity as of 2015 she was estimated to be worth over 30 million on her own or 4553 million with her husband clinton resigned from the foundations board in april 2015 when she began her presidential campaign and the foundation said it would accept new foreign governmental donations from six western nations only    2016 presidential campaign   on april 12 2015 clinton formally announced her candidacy for the presidency in the 2016 election she had a campaigninwaiting already in place including a large donor network experienced operatives and the ready for hillary and priorities usa action political action committees and other infrastructure the campaigns headquarters were established in the new york city borough of brooklyn focuses of her campaign have included raising middle class incomes establishing universal preschool and making college more affordable and improving the affordable care act initially considered a prohibitive favorite to win the democratic nomination clinton has faced an unexpectedly strong challenge from selfprofessed democratic socialist senator bernie sanders of vermont whose longtime stance against the influence of corporations and the wealthy in american politics has resonated with a dissatisfied citizenry troubled by the effects of income inequality in the us and has contrasted with clintons wall street ties  in the initial contest of the primaries season clinton only very narrowly won the iowa democratic caucuses held february 1 over an increasingly popular sanders making her the first woman to win the iowa caucuses in the first primary held in new hampshire on february 9 she lost to sanders by a wide margin sanders was an increasing threat in the next contest the nevada caucuses on february 20 but clinton managed a fivepercentagepoint win aided by finaldays campaigning among casino workers she followed that with a lopsided victory in the south carolina primary on february 27 these two victories stabilized her campaign and showed an avoidance of the management turmoil that harmed her 2008 effort on the march 1 super tuesday clinton won seven of eleven contests including a string of dominating victories across the south buoyed as in south carolina by africanamerican voters and opened up a significant lead in pledged delegates over sanders she has maintained this delegate lead across subsequent contests over the next several weeks with a consistent pattern through the year being that sanders has done better among younger whiter more rural and more liberal voters and in states that hold caucuses or where eligibility is open to independents while clinton does better among older and more diverse voter populations and in states that hold primaries or where eligibility is restricted to registered democrats    political positions   several organizations have attempted to measure clintons place on the political spectrum scientifically using her senate votes national journals 2004 study of rollcall votes assigned clinton a rating of 30 in the political spectrum relative to the senate at the time with a rating of 1 being most liberal and 100 being most conservative national journals subsequent rankings placed her as the 32ndmost liberal senator in 2006 and 16thmost liberal senator in 2007 a 2004 analysis by political scientists joshua d clinton of princeton university and simon jackman and doug rivers of stanford university found her to be likely the sixthtoeighthmost liberal senator the almanac of american politics edited by michael barone and richard e cohen rated her votes from 2003 through 2006 as liberal or conservative with 100 as the highest rating in three areas economic social and foreign averaged for the four years the ratings are economic  75

the popular media as a polarizing figure with some arguing otherwise james madison university political science professor valerie sulfaros 2007 study used the american national election studies feeling thermometer polls which measure the degree of opinion about a political figure to find that such polls during clintons first lady years confirm the conventional wisdom that hillary clinton is

symbolic negotiation of female identity in particular anderson states there has been a cultural bias towards traditional first ladies and a cultural prohibition against modern first ladies by the time of clinton the first lady position had become a site of heterogeneity and paradox burrell as well as biographers jeff gerth and don van natta jr note that clinton achieved her highest approval ratings as first lady late in 1998 not for professional or political achievements of her own but for being seen as the victim of her husbands very public infidelity university of pennsylvania communications

hampshire events brought an odd truth to light though hillary rodham clinton has been on the periphery or in the middle of national life for decades  she is one of the most recognizable but least understood figures in american politics  once she became secretary of state clintons image seemed to improve dramatically among the american public and become one of a respected world figure she

poll and in 2015 she was named the most admired woman by americans for a record fourteenth straight time and twentieth time overall her favorability ratings dropped however after she left office and began to be viewed in the context of partisan politics again by september 2015 with her 2016 presidential campaign underway and beset by continued reports regarding her private email usage at the state department her ratings had slumped to the some of her lowest levels ever during 2016 she acknowledged that im not a natural politician in case you havent noticed journalist indira a r lakshmanan who has covered clinton extensively both as a presidential candidate and as secretary of state believes that clintons persona is almost completely different in the two roles and that while clinton definitely has the political skills that an officeholder needs clearly however something seems to happen to clinton when the task is asking people to vote for her    electoral history     notes

he had developed his rapping long before he began producing it was often a challenge for west to be accepted as a rapper and he struggled to attain a record deal multiple record companies ignored him because he did not portray the gangsta image prominent in mainstream hip hop at the time after a series of meetings with capitol records west was ultimately denied an artist deal according to capitol

he recorded the remainder of the album in los angeles while recovering from the car accident once he had completed the album it was leaked months before its release date however west decided to use the opportunity to review the album and the college dropout was significantly remixed remastered and revised before being released as a result certain tracks originally destined for the album were subsequently retracted among them keep the receipt with ol dirty bastard and the good the bad and the ugly with consequence west meticulously refined the production adding string arrangements gospel

us and garnered west 10 grammy nominations including album of the year and best rap album which it received during this period west also founded good music a record label and management company that would go on to house affiliate artists and producers such as no id and john legend at the time the focal point of wests production style was the use of spedup vocal samples from soul records however partly because of the acclaim of the college dropout such sampling had been much copied by others with that overuse and also because west felt he had become too dependent on the technique he decided to find a new sound  beginning his second effort that fall west would invest two million dollars and take over a year to craft his second album west was significantly inspired by roseland nyc live a 1998 live album by english trip hop group portishead produced with the new york philharmonic orchestra early in his career the live album had inspired him to incorporate string arrangements into his hiphop production though west had not been able to afford many live instruments around the time of his debut album the money from his commercial success enabled him to hire a string orchestra for his second album late registration west collaborated with american film score composer jon brion who served as the albums coexecutive producer for several tracks although brion had no prior experience in creating hiphop records he and west found that they could productively work together after their first afternoon in the studio where they discovered that neither confined his musical knowledge and

graduation and 808s  heartbreak   fresh off spending the previous year touring the world with u2 on their vertigo tour west felt inspired to compose anthemic rap songs that could operate more efficiently in large arenas to this end west incorporated the synthesizer into his hiphop production utilized slower tempos and experimented with electronic music and influenced by music of the 1980s in addition to u2 west drew musical inspiration from arena rock bands such as the rolling stones and led zeppelin in terms of melody and chord progression to make his next effort the third in a planned tetralogy of educationthemed studio albums more introspective and personal in lyricism west listened to folk and country singersongwriters bob dylan and johnny cash in hopes of developing methods to augment his wordplay and storytelling ability  wests third studio album graduation garnered major publicity when its release date pitted west in a sales competition against rapper 50 cents curtis upon their september 2007 releases graduation outsold curtis by a large margin debuting at number one on the us billboard 200 chart and selling 957000 copies in its first week graduation once

electroinfused music in the late 2000s ben detrick of xxl cited the outcome of the sales competition between 50 cents curtis and wests graduation as being responsible for altering the direction of hiphop and paving the way for new rappers who didnt follow the hardcoregangster mold writing if there was ever a watershed moment to indicate hiphops changing direction it may have come when 50 cent competed with kanye in 2007 to see whose album would claim superior sales wests life took a different direction when his mother donda west died of complications from cosmetic surgery involving abdominoplasty and breast reduction in november 2007 months later west and fiance alexis phifer ended their engagement and their longterm intermittent relationship which had begun in 2002 the events profoundly affected west who set off for his 2008 glow in the dark tour shortly thereafter purportedly because his emotions could not be conveyed through rapping west decided to sing using the voice

revealed itself to be kanyes most vulnerable work and perhaps his most brilliant wests controversial incident the following year at the 2009 mtv video music awards was arguably his biggest controversy

musical career has been defined by frequent stylistic shifts and has seen him develop and explore a variety of different musical approaches and genres when asked about his early musical inspirations he has named artists such as a tribe called quest stevie wonder michael jackson george michael ll cool j phil collins and madonna west has named puff daddy as the most important cultural figure in his life and he has also described david bowie as one of his most important inspirations west was formatively mentored by chicago producer no id who introduced him to hip hop production in the early 1990s allowing a teenage west to sit in on recording sessions early in his career west pioneered a style of production dubbed chipmunk soul which utilized pitchedup vocal samples usually from soul and rb songs along with his own drums and instrumentation his first major release featuring his trademark soulful vocal sampling style was this cant be life a track from jayzs the dynasty roc la familia west has said that wutang clan producer rza influenced him in his style and has named wutang rappers ghostface killah and ol dirty bastard as inspirations rza spoke positively of the comparisons stating in an interview for rolling stone i got super respect for kanye  he is going to inspire people to be like him west further developed his style on his 2004 debut album the college dropout after a rough version was leaked he meticulously refined the production adding string arrangements gospel choirs and improved drum programming  for his second album late registration 2005 he collaborated with film score composer jon brion and drew influence from nonrap influences such as english trip hop group portishead blending wests primary soulful hip hop production with brions elaborate chamber pop orchestration the album experimentally incorporated a wide array of different genres and prominent orchestral elements including string arrangements piano chords brass flecks and horn riffs among other symphonic instrumentation it also incorporated a myriad of foreign and vintage instruments not typical in popular music let alone hip hop such as a celesta harpsichord chamberlin cs80 analog synthesizer chinese bells and berimbau vibraphones and marimba rolling stone described late registration as west claiming the whole world of music as hiphop turf chronicling the album as his mad quest to explode every clich about hiphop identity critic robert christgau wrote that theres never been hiphop so complex and subtle musically for a period of time kanye west stood as the sole current pop star to tour with a string section as audible on his 2006 live album late orchestration    middle period  with his third album graduation 2007 west moved away from the soulful sound of his previous releases and towards a more atmospheric rocktinged electronicinfluenced soundscape under the belief that late registration had been too indulgent and poorly arranged he fashioned graduation to contain less ornate production made the album completely devoid of skits and attempted to sequence it as a tighter more cohesive package the musical evolution arose from him listening to music genres encompassing european britpop and eurodisco american alternative and indierock and his native chicago house towards this end west retracted much of the live instrumentation that characterized his previous album and replaced it with heavy gothic synthesizers distorted synthchords rave stabs house beats electrodisco rhythms and a wide array of modulated electronic noises and digital audioeffects in addition west drew musical inspiration from arena rock bands such as the rolling stones u2 and led zeppelin in terms of melody and chord progression similar to its predecessor the album wasnt confined to the conventional looping techniques typical of contemporary hiphop and instead continued to implement sudden musical shifts within its multilayered song structures and express intricately composed introductions bridges and codas  conceived in the wake of several distressing personal events wests fourth studio album 808s  heartbreak 2008 marked a radical departure from his previous releases largely abandoning rap and hip hop stylings in favor of a stark electropop sound composed utilizing the roland tr808 drum machine the autotune vocal processor and virtual synthesis technology the albums music features austere production and elements such as droning synthesizers dense drums lengthy strings and somber piano and drew comparisons to the work of 1980s postpunk and new wave groups west would confess an affinity with artists such as joy division gary numan tj swan and boy george and later described 808s as the first black new wave album maintaining a minimal but functional approach towards the albums studio production west explored the electronic feel produced by his explicitly autotuned vocals and manipulated the sounds created by the 808 modulating its pitch to produce a distorted electronic sound he then sought to juxtapose mechanical sounds with the traditional sounds of taiko drums and choir monks rolling stone journalist matthew trammell asserted that the record was ahead of its time and wrote in a 2012 article now that popular music has finally caught up to it 808s  heartbreak has revealed itself to be kanyes most vulnerable work and perhaps his most brilliant west recorded his fifth album my beautiful dark twisted fantasy 2010 with a wide range of collaborators it has been noted by writers for its maximalist aesthetic and its incorporation of elements from wests previous four albums entertainment weeklys simon vozicklevinson noted that such elements all recur at various points namely the luxurious soul of 2004s the college dropout the symphonic pomp of late registration the gloss of 2007s graduation and the emotionally exhausted electro of 2008s 808s  heartbreak allmusics andy kellman views it as the culmination of those albums while noting that it does not merely draw characteristics from each one of them the 13 tracks  sometimes fuse them together simultaneously consequently the sonic and emotional layers are often difficult to pry apart and enumerate kellman emphasized the track all of the lights as most representative of the albums contrasting elements and maniacal extravagance robert christgau writing for msn music commented that the music eschews the grace of the college dropout and late registration for grandiosity and sonic luxuries    recent work  describing his sixth studio album yeezus 2013 as a protest to music west embraced an abrasive style that incorporated a variety of unconventional influences music critic greg kot described it as a hostile abrasive and intentionally offputting album that combines the worlds of 1980s acidhouse and contemporary chicago drill music 1990s industrial music and the avantrap of saul williams death grips and odd future the album also incorporates elements of trap music as well as dancehall punk and electro inspired by the minimalist design of le corbusier and primarily electronic in nature the album features distorted drum machines and synthesizers that sound like theyre malfunctioning lowresolution samplers that add a pixelated digital aura to the most analog sounds to this end the album incorporates glitches reminiscent of cd skips or corrupted mp3s and autotuned vocals are modulated to a point in which they are difficult to decipher it also continues wests practice of eclectic samples he employs a sample of nina simones strange fruit an obscure hindi sample on i am a god and a sample of 1970s hungarian rock group omega on new slaves on sight interpolates a melody from sermon hell give us what we really need by the holy name of mary choral family rolling stone called the album a brilliant obsessivecompulsive career autocorrect released in 2016 after several years of delays wests seventh album the life of pablo was noted for its raw occasionally even intentionally messy composition in distinction to wests previous albums rolling stone wrote that this is a messy album that feels like it was made that way on purpose after the lasersharp intensity of yeezus stating that its designed to sound like a work in progress carl wilson of slate characterized the album as creating strange links between kanyes many iterationssoulsample enthusiast heartbroken autotune crooner hedonistic avantpop composer industrialrap shittalker suggesting that the point is that in the context of all this sonic landscaping in wests kamikaze moodswinging way pablo now seems undeniably not halfassedly as id been about to conclude like an album of struggle he also noted the albums use of autotune a cappella as well as bass and percussion lines that are only the tailend decay of some lost starting place some vanished rhythmic eden west initially characterized the release as a gospel album greg kot of the chicago tribune wrote in his review of the life of pablo wests version of gospel touches on some of those sonic cues  heavy organ soaring choirs  but seems more preoccupied with gospel text and the notion of redemption    other ventures     fashion  early in his career west made clear his interest in fashion and desire to work in the clothing design industry in september 2005 west announced that he would release his pastelle clothing line in spring 2006 claiming now that i have a grammy under my belt and late registration is finished i am ready to launch my clothing line next spring the line was

concert for hurricane relief west a featured speaker accused president george w bush of not caring about black people when west was presenting alongside actor mike myers he deviated from the prepared script to criticize the medias portrayal of hurricane victims saying  i hate the way they portray us in the media you see a black family it says theyre looting you see a white family it says theyre looking for food and you know its been five days waiting for federal help because most of the people are black and even for me to complain about it i would be a hypocrite because ive tried to turn away from the tv because its too hard to watch ive even been shopping before even giving a donation so now im calling my business manager right now to see what is the biggest amount i can give and just to imagine if i was down there and those are my people down there so anybody out there that wants to do anything that we can helpwith the way america is set up to help the poor the black people the less welloff as slow as possible i mean the red cross is doing everything they can we already realize a lot of people that could help are at war right now fighting another wayand theyve given them permission to go down and shoot us  myers spoke next and continued to read the script once it was wests turn to speak again he said george bush doesnt care about black people at this point telethon producer rick kaplan cut off the microphone and then cut away to chris tucker who was unaware of the cut for a few seconds still wests comment reached much of the united states bush stated in an

bush i would tell george bush in my moment of frustration i didnt have the grounds to call him a racist he told lauer i believe that in a situation of high emotion like that we as human beings dont always choose the right words the following day bush reacted to the apology in a live interview with lauer saying he appreciated the rappers remorse im not a hater bush said i dont hate kanye west i was talking about an environment in which people were willing to say things that hurt nobody wants to be called a racist if in your heart you believe in equality of races reactions were mixed but some felt that west had no need to apologize it was not the particulars of your words that mattered it was the essence of a feeling of the insensitivity towards our communities that many of us have felt for far too long argued def jam cofounder russell simmons bush himself was receptive to the apology saying i appreciate that it wasnt just kanye west who was talking like that during katrina i cited him as an example i cited others as an example as well you know i appreciate that in september 2013 west was widely rebuked by human rights groups for performing in kazakhstan at the wedding of

money and obama and no money people want to say obama cant make these moves or hes not executing thats because he aint got those connections black people dont have the same level of connections as jewish peoplewe aint jewish we dont got family that got money like that in response to his comments the antidefamation league stated there it goes again the ageold canard that jews are allpowerful and control the levers of power in government on december 21 2013 west backed off of the original comment and told a chicago radio station that i thought i was giving a compliment but if anything it came off more ignorant i dont know how being told you have money is an insult in february 2016 west again became embroiled in controversy when he posted a tweet seemingly asserting bill cosbys innocence in

concert in brisbane he later spoofed the incident on the 33rd season premiere of saturday night live in september 2007 on september 9 2007 west suggested that his race had something to do with his

definitely didnt want or need that and concluding with im sorry taylor he also revealed he had written a song for swift and if she did not accept the song he would perform it himself however on november 8 2010 in an interview with a minnesota radio station he seemed to recant his past apologies by attempting to describe the act at the 2009 awards show as selfless and downgrade the perception of disrespect it created in famous a track from his 2016 album the life of pablo west implies that this incident led to swifts stardom rapping i feel like me and taylor might still have sex why i made that bitch famous after some media backlash about the reference west posted on twitter i did not diss taylor swift and ive never dissed herfirst thing is im an artist and as an artist i will express

among the most critically acclaimed artists of the twentyfirst century receiving praise from music critics fans fellow musicians artists and wider cultural figures for his work allmusic editor jason birchmeier writes of his impact as his career progressed throughout the early 21st century west shattered certain stereotypes about rappers becoming a superstar on his own terms without adapting his appearance his rhetoric or his music to fit any one musical mold jon caramanica of the new york times said that west has been a frequent lightning rod for controversy a bombastic figure who can count rankling two presidents among his achievements village voice media senior editor ben westhoff dubbed him the greatest hip hop artist of all time writing that hes made the best albums and changed the game the most and his music is the most likely to endure while complex called him the 21st centurys most important artist of any art form of any genre in 2016 the guardian compared west to the late david bowie within the modern mainstream arguing that there is nobody else who can sell as many records as west does  while remaining so resolutely experimental and capable of stirring things up culturally and politically wests middleclass background flamboyant fashion sense and outspokenness have set him apart from other rappers rolling stone credited west with transforming hip hops mainstream establishing a style of introspective yet glossy rap  and called him as interesting and complicated a pop star as the 2000s produceda rapper who mastered upped and moved beyond the hiphop game a producer who created a signature sound and then abandoned it to his imitators a flashy freespending sybarite with insightful things to say about college culture and economics an egomaniac with more than enough artistic firepower to back it up early in his career he was among the first rappers to publicly criticize the preponderance of homophobia in hip hop the sales competition between rapper 50 cents curtis and wests graduation altered the direction of hip hop and helped pave the way for new rappers who did not follow the hardcoregangster mold rosie swash of the guardian viewed the

mans alternative his 2008 album 808s  heartbreak polarized both listeners and critics upon its release but was commercially successful and impacted hip hop and pop stylistically as it laid the groundwork for a new wave of artists who generally eschewed typical rap braggadocio for intimate subject matter and introspection including frank ocean the weeknd drake future kid cudi childish gambino lil durk chief keef and soulja boy according to ben detrick of xxl magazine west effectively led a new wave of artists including kid cudi wale lupe fiasco kidz in the hall and drake who lacked

modesty and he shouldnt  he fought for his place in the cultural pantheon with a purpose in his debut album over a decade ago kanye issued what amounted to a social critique and a call to arms with a beat we rappers is role models we rap we dont think but kanye does think constantly about everything and he wants everybody else to do the same to engage question push boundaries now that hes a popculture juggernaut he has the platform to achieve just that hes not afraid of being judged or ridiculed in the process kanyes been playing the long game all along and were only just beginning to see why  drake nicki minaj and casey veggies have acknowledged being influenced directly by west nonrap artists such as english singersongwriters adele and lily allen new zealand artist lorde english

K-means initializes with a pre-determined number of clusters (I chose 5). Each observation is assigned to a cluster (cluster assignment) so as to minimize the within cluster sum of squares. Next, the mean of the clustered observations is calculated and used as the new cluster centroid. Then, observations are reassigned to clusters and centroids recalculated in an iterative process until the algorithm reaches convergence."
